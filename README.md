## Introduction

### Symbiotic economy

LivesOne is a new block chain project created by the Symbiosis Foundation and its technical cooperation team, the target is to build a new technology based on commercial chain block Model - symbiosis economic model. Symbiosis economy refers to an independent economic organization sharing the same resource or complementary different resource for the purpose of will form a symbiosis, the formation of such symbionts caused the improvement of direct or indirect resource allocation efficiency inside or outside economic organizations. The target of LivesOne is to make businesses and users benefit both sides, mutual promotion and common development, symbiotic economic symbiosis.

### Symbiotic System 

#### Introduction of Symbiotic System

The symbiotic system of the ecological system building block chain is based on technology, the core is to generate an encrypted database for each node, the database consists of three parts: the user common data (OpenID), user behavior data (user generated data on the network) and an encryption encryption for the books, books records each terminal contribution value, reputation value and trading information.

Block chain in recent years is one of the most revolutionary new technology. It is the essence of a distributed billing system to the center, its core value is to let the person or organization in the absence of authority under the supervision of the mutual cooperation of each other to establish trust. Generally speaking, block chains are a common way of accounting through network nodes. The implementation of distributed database information is highly accurate and safe, the data (block) are superimposed in time sequence (chain) to generate permanent, do not tamper with the record, to build trust-building network system.

## Background

### Problems in the development of the Internet

#### User cost increasing

From the PC to the mobile Internet, a group on dividend express Internet products has been the rapid rise. Today, traffic dividends disappear, the Golden Age came to an abrupt end. In order to survive, large enterprises spend huge sums of money on advertising, passive follow-up of competitors, and then trigger a money-burning war, users will only see advertising. The intensity of the swing, small businesses lack of funds, can only use a variety of vulgar marketing means to attract eyeballs, but also can get the user's whim with little effect.

The increasingly fierce competition environment, serious homogenization of products, in recent years, to get the user cost exponential rise. Soared from a few dollars to tens of dollars, or even hundreds of yuan, mutual. The networking industry is at the crossroads of development  once again .

#### User loyalty continues to decline

The rise of Internet Co, products emerge in an endless stream and the homogenization of serious, user loyalty is disappearing, user retention rate reduced year by year.

At the product level, over reliance on the channel, push advertising, because users will push advertising or product moment, will also push for more advertising, in the brand level,  more and more young Internet users began to pursue personalized, even the advantages of industry giants in the brand also gradually fade away.
So, the effect of the function of the product and brand, are losing their due value, in excessive homogenization of the product market, customer loyalty has disappeared.

#### The establishment of businesses and users need deeper connection

At present, many businesses compete for users all the way, the entire industry is filled with all kinds of vicious competition and inefficient marketing, not only high cost, but also destroying the market and the environment. Mutual plagiarism in the product, a slightly advantage will also be competing products quickly tied, completely unable to reshape customer loyalty.

The reason is that the existing business model is not suitable for a wide range of market development, product function. Free service alone has been unable to maintain relations between merchants and customers department. Sustainable development of the industry requires us to break away from the original mode of thinking, upgrade the existing business model in an all-round way, and thoroughly solve the problem that the cost of acquiring users is too high and users are too expensive.

## Development Plan

### Advantage

More equitable: Do not support mining machine, equal access;
More flexible: Support lightning trading, no fee model;
More safety: From the well-known Internet team operation, high safety coefficient;
Landing: Grafting mature Internet model, application landing directly;
Fast growth: Sitting on tens of millions of users, the system can rapidly expand the scale of the appreciation of space - a fixed number of additional.

##### The logic of  appreciation 

I. Scarcity:
The symbiotic system introduced the mainstream Internet applications, such as maxthon browser, users are basically in the million or more. The distribution of tokens will be speedy quick progress, and with the increasing difficulty of mining, free access to tokens will be reduced, thus prompting users to trade through the secondary market.
Ii. Circulability:
Speed, with increasing difficulty, free access to the token channel will be reduced, which prompted the user through the two level market transactions. Common students will also visit a variety of mainstream currency exchanges at home and abroad, to further enhance liquidity.
III. Appreciation from ecosystem development:
We believe that the digital currency market will have to follow the development of its ecosystem, we will rely on the Beijing science and Technology Co., the introduction of various ecological manufacturers enter into a symbiosis system, with all enter the mainstream manufacturers, we believe the market will continuous improvement.

The early development of the Internet is in 1999, businesses to sell products, collect fees to the user, as the charge economy;

In 2006, with the rapid growth of the Internet, enterprises rely on advertising for profit, and users use products free of charge, which is regarded as the free economy era.

Today, in the face of increasingly fierce market competition, in order to solve the problem of product homogeneity, customer loyalty is low, the user cost of a series of problems, the market needs a business with users have the income model, in order to achieve the purpose of sustainable development, called the symbiotic economic era.

The key point lies in the economic symbiosis in the use of the Internet user behavior in the process of quantization, let the user behavior produce economic value, allowing users to get revenue, then up to increase user loyalty, finally realizes the enterprise and users of common benefit, common development, common prosperity and sustainable development of the Ecological Symbiosis relationship.

### Value

The establishment of LivesOne, the user's network value is ignored, the user account in the use of the Internet in the process of creating, browsing the web, content, evaluation enjoyment, online shopping and other activities are creating value, which increases the activity, retention, and even payment conversion of the website, but users do not get anything.

LivesOne is hoping to build a new relationship in which consumers and businesses form a symbiotic ecosystem based on their interests. In ecology In the circle, each entity will be used as an anchor point to track its contribution value and credit. Every day, according to the dynamic algorithm, it will be acquired in the form of LVT. Distribution of interests.

## Application

### Mining Browser

The symbiotic community has created a Maxthon Browser plug-in package and generated a mining browser". Mining Browser Will be the first application of LivesOne. Maxthon Browser 's global billions of users can benefit from the LivesOne system, and become the early holder of LVT. By earning LVT, the user loyalty and activity of mining browsers will be effectively enhanced. Users of Maxthon Browser will make LVT holders fast increase, thus conducive to the rapid establishment of a distributed network, accelerate the establishment of symbiosis economic system. At the same time, the foundation will allocate a certain amount of LVT as an incentive, make measures to get more users and businesses to join the symbiotic economic system.

### Symbiotic Wallet

Symbiosis is the purse, wallet application on LivesOne, bind the user account, can achieve higher transaction efficiency within the system, characteristics of lower cost. In the generation of transceiver the management of currency, transaction and transfer process, the design more simple hidden block chain complex logic, create an ordinary user can quickly get started the digital currency application. The use and popularization of growth symbiotic coins.

### Symbiotic SDK

In order to rapidly increase the number of other eco-manufacturers in the symbiotic system, the symbiotic system will build a SDK that encapsulates token consumption. And the symbiotic system team will provide a series of technical support services, in order to facilitate access to various ecological vendors.

### Symbiotic API

The LivesOne team aims to provide symbiotic currency in different application scenarios, universal API interface design, so that businesses and users can use the most simple way in your product Consumer applications embedded in the page or tokens, such as the use of coins to pay a reward, symbiosis, red etc.. Even every user can copy the shape of the code type, in their own micro-blog or broadcast interface embedded in the application, the symbiotic coin has become more simple.

### Access of other eco-manufacturers

The rapid development of the symbiotic system will introduce a variety of mainstream Internet application. A large number of partners at Maxthon browser will be selected as the first phase of partnership manufacturer. There are 30% tokens of the symbiotic system will be distributed through the ecological design in manufacturers. This is conducive to the rapid expansion of the ecological system of the token, accelerating maturity and prosperity.
